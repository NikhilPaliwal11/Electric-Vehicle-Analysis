Dataset is about Electric Vehicle in development in your world now.

ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Analysis Using Power BI ðŸš—
ðŸ’» Dataset from Kaggle.

Excited to share the results of my latest project leveraging Power BI and MS Excel! ðŸ“Š

I conducted a thorough analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data, delving into key metrics shaping the EV landscape. 

 Here are some highlights:
 
ðŸ”¹ Total Vehicles: Analyzed data on 150.42K electric vehicles, uncovering insights into market size and growth trends.

ðŸ”¹ Average Electric Range: Discovered that the average electric range across all vehicles stands at 67.3 miles, a crucial factor influencing consumer choice.

ðŸ”¹ Market Growth: Electric vehicle sales surged by over 50% year over year, signaling a promising trajectory for the EV market.

ðŸ”¹ Geographic Adoption: Identified Washington state in the US as the leader in EV adoption, shedding light on regional preferences.

ðŸ”¹ Manufacturer Insights: Tesla dominates the market with a 46% share, followed closely by Nissan, with Tesla's Model Y emerging as the most popular model.

The interactive dashboard I created using Power BI offers comprehensive visualizations,
from line charts tracking sales growth to map charts showcasing regional adoption patterns. ðŸ“ˆ

This analysis holds valuable insights for stakeholders in the EV industry, guiding strategic decisions and shaping future developments.

Excited to continue exploring the intersection of data analysis and sustainable transportation! Let's drive towards a greener future together. ðŸŒ¿âš¡
